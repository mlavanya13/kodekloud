## Solutions for Kodekloud Engineer
### Introduction
This GIT project contains my own solutions to the tasks in Kodekloud Engineer. As a personal advise, please use the solutions only for your reference. It's best that you attempt the tasks yourself first by reading through the original documentation. This will immensely help you develop your skills. After all, that's the objective of Kodekloud Engineer isn't it?

### General Tips
* **Begin with the end in mind**
    * Always begin the task with an idea on how to verify the successful completion of the task. For verification guidance and other specific guidance on individual topics, follow the links below:
      * [Linux System Administration tasks](./linux/README.md)
      * [Kubernetes tasks](./kubernetes/README.md)
      * [Docker tasks](./docker/README.md)
      * [Ansible tasks](./ansible/README.md)
      * [Puppet tasks](./puppet/README.md)
      * [Jenkins tasks](./jenkins/README.md)
* **It's okay to "Try Later"**
  * If you think you took too much time to perform the task or you screwed up the environment, click `Try Later` and come back to the task again. Most importantly, read through the question again as the question values will change with each reload of the question.
* **Go for Bonus points**
  * If you complete the task within 15 minutes, you get half of the task points as bonus points. For example, if the task is 500 points worth, if you complete the task in less than 15 minutes, you will get 500 + 250 points. 
  * One tip is to take as much time to get the question right, save the answer in a Text Editor on your computer, click `Try Later` and redo the task again. But this time within 15 minutes to earn bonus points. Don't forget to re-read the question.
* **Make it easy for the Reviewers** 
  * If you are copy-pasting code in to vi editor, pause for 5-10 secs so that reviewers would be able to take one good look at the code during reviews
  * Use `more` command for files, so that reviewers can clearly see the content
  * Perform steps in the same tab, if possible, as only the main tab is recorded
  * Run state verification steps so that reviewers can cross-check the outcome of tasks e.g. `curl`, state output steps e.g. `kubectl get pods` / `systemctl status`
